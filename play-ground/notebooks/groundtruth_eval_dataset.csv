Abstract
Recently, retrieval-augmented text generation","The topic of the paper 'A Survey on Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation' is the exploration and analysis of retrieval-augmented text generation methods in computational linguistics. It discusses the advantages of these methods over conventional generation models and their state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks. The paper reviews notable approaches to retrieval-augmented text generation, particularly in the context of dialogue response generation, machine translation, and other generation tasks, and suggests important future research directions."
